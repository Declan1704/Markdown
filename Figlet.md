# FIGLET
* `-f` to select a font.

* `-d` to select the font directory.

* `-c` centers the output text.

* `-l` align the text to the left.

* `-r` aligns the text to the right.

* `-w` specify an output size.

* `-k` enables kerning, creating each letter separately instead of merging with the adjacent ones.


## Establish a Justified Align

If we want the output to be created in the center, we will use the -c argument.

Ex: `figlet -c <Enter your text>`


## Define output width

We will also be able to control the output width with the -w argument.

Ex: `figlet -w (number for spacing. Default is 80) <Enter your text>`
